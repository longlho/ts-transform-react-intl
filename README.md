# ts-transform-react-intl

Extracts string messages for translation from modules that use React Intl (similar to [`babel-plugin-react-intl`](https://github.com/yahoo/babel-plugin-react-intl)). Right now this requires `typescript@^2.3` which is not released yet.

Take a look at [`compile.ts`](compile.ts) for example in integration.
